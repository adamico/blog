title: Welcome to Jekyll
layout: post
---
Another attempt at a blog... I tried 'em all: blogger, wordpress, tumblr...
I gave up adding posts sooner or later. I don't think it's because I lacked inspiration, just that I wanted something more homebrew, for hackers...

Well, here I am with Jekyll.

I'm a Ruby (and Rails) apprentice developer with no formal IT education. I've been coding seriously for a little more than a year and I simply love Ruby syntax.

In this blog I'll talk about code, photography, life and whatsoever.

See you around!
